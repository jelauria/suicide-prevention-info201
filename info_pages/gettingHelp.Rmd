# Getting Help

Although it's interesting to talk about the statistics surrounding suicide, this should not detract from the fact that suicide is a very serious matter. Please, if you or someone you know are experiencing suicidal thoughts, get help immediately. Remember: you are not alone, and you are loved. There are people out there who want to listen, and one conversation can save a life.
